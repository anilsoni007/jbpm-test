Ahh üëç that makes sense ‚Äî you‚Äôre hitting a classic jBPM (and KIE/Drools) issue when fronted by an Ingress/ALB.

Here‚Äôs why:

Business Central (Workbench) is a GWT (Google Web Toolkit) app that makes a ton of AJAX calls.

By default, it generates absolute URLs like http://<pod-ip>:8080/business-central/... instead of respecting the Ingress hostname.

When you use ALB Ingress, those callbacks fail (because browsers can‚Äôt reach pod IPs directly), so after login you just see a spinner.

‚úÖ Fix: Tell jBPM to use the external hostname/path

You need to set -Dorg.kie.workbench.context (and related system properties) so that Business Central generates the right URLs.

Update Business Central Deployment

Add this to the containers.env section of the Business Central deployment:

- name: JAVA_OPTS_APPEND
  value: >
    -Dorg.kie.server.location=http://<YOUR-DOMAIN>/kieserver/services/rest/server
    -Dorg.kie.workbench.context=http://<YOUR-DOMAIN>/business-central
    -Dorg.uberfire.nio.git.dir=/opt/jboss/wildfly/standalone/data/git


Where <YOUR-DOMAIN> is the host you set in the Ingress (e.g. jbpm.mydomain.com).

Example Snippet:
containers:
  - name: business-central
    image: quay.io/kiegroup/business-central-workbench:7.73.0.Final
    ports:
      - containerPort: 8080
    envFrom:
      - secretRef:
          name: jbpm-credentials
    env:
      - name: JAVA_OPTS_APPEND
        value: >
          -Dorg.kie.server.location=http://jbpm.mydomain.com/kieserver/services/rest/server
          -Dorg.kie.workbench.context=http://jbpm.mydomain.com/business-central
